Since childhood, at the age of four, drawing has been my unwavering passion. At 15, I immersed myself deeply in the world of realistic drawing, committing myself to excellence in every stroke. Each piece I conceive is meticulously crafted, from its inception to the final delivery, reflecting my commitment to quality and precision. Currently based in SÃ£o Paulo, I share my art through prints, aiming to convey a unique perspective of the world to those who appreciate my artistic expression.","image":{"src":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/8438/fca0a148-cc1a-41a4-aea4-6d897a4e20a5","alt":"Drawing of two men talking"}},{"__resolveType":"site/sections/Image/EaselGallery.tsx"},{"__resolveType":"Footer"}],"__resolveType":"website/pages/Page.tsx"}
